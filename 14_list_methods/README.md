# List Methods
## In Lists, you could use a lot of methods to perform different actions on them.
```python 
#Examples:
people = ["Allen", "Michael", "John", "Ben"]
numbers = [7,5,1,9,2,21,19]
#append - Method to add an element to a list

#remove - Method to delete an element from a list
#             Argument as the element to delete

#pop    - Method to delete an element from a list
#             Argument as the index of element to delete

#sort - Will sort the list of elements
#           default sort for str - Alphabetically
#           default sort for int - low to high

people.append("Jim")
people.remove("Allen")
people.pop(0)
people.sort()
numbers.sort()
```
