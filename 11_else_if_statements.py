#Else if Statements

#Sometimes we might want to extend our decision making when we create if statements. Else if could help us to create more conditions to decide what lines of code to execute


#You can change both those values to test the results of this program
is_snowing = True
is_raining = True
if is_snowing:
    print("It's extremely cold outside")
elif is_raining:
    print("It's not so cold outside")
else:
    print("It's not cold outside")

#If, Elif and Else are associated together.
#It is important to remember that Python will always look to enter one statement in one nested If statement.
