# Tuples
## Tuples are the immutable version of Lists, Immutable means that once you declare the tuple, you are not allowed to change it's content any more
```python 
#Lists - []
#Tuples - ()

days = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")

#To store days of the week as a tuple is a great idea.
#Because it is obvious that the content does not need to be changed

#Indexing is supported

print(days[0]) # Monday
print(days[1]) # Tuesday
```
